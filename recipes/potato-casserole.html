    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe was given to me, and I continue to pass it down to
        everyone who tries it! Aside from being so delicious, it's so
        versatile that I've even used it as a side dish for steak!
        This can be made the night before, then baked the next day --
        allow 10 extra minutes of cooking time.</h3>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds new potatoes, skinned, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 pound processed cheese food, cubed</li>
        <li>2 cups mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound bacon, cooked crisp and chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
            Place potatoes in a large pan, fill with water to cover
            potatoes, and bring to a boil. Cook until potatoes are
            just soft. Drain, place in a large bowl. While the
            potatoes are still hot, gently stir in cheese without
            mashing potatoes. Continue to stir, every minute or so,
            until cheese is melted.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a separate bowl, stir together mayonnaise, onion, and
            bacon. Gently stir into potatoes and cheese. Spread into
            a 13x9-inch baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated oven for 50 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
