    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chocolate cake is made with cocoa and hot coffee. It has been
        in my family forever. The secret is to not overbake it — that will
        ruin a chocolate cake every time.</h3>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup hot, strong coffee</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease
            and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, stir together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking
            powder, and baking soda. Add oil, milk, eggs, and vanilla;
            mix until smooth. Stir in hot coffee last. Spread evenly
            into the prepared pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 35 minutes, or until
            a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean.
        </li>
    </ol>
